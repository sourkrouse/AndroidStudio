Mobile application projects from CS360
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The purpose of the application will be to track your weight daily and let the app encourage you toward your goal weight. 
Other features will include a milestone greeting during the progress, a login entry to secure your data, and an email reminder. 
The goal of this application for each user is to see your progress day to day, as you go through a weight-loss journey. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? 
Why were your designs successful?
There were 3 main screens needed for the intial phase of this app - a login screen, a registration screen, and a weight list screen. Some fragment screens were required
to handle small tasks, such as adding a new weight or changing preferences. The user could move eaither forward or backward through each screen, and the flow was intiutive.
The design is successful because it is simple, standard, and not cluttered.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I used modules in zyBooks plus some online learning content to help with the programming sections that I was unfamiliar with. There were several examples in the 
Android Developer warehouse that I could apply to my design. In the future, I would build templates to help coding repeated strategies simple and have less overhead.


How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Android Studio has a very typical debugging system using a screen called Logcat, and adding some breakpoints. These were very helpful with identifying run-time errors. 
I was also able to hard-code some values to test that code was pulling data from the database. I used a Log function to display data in the log when debugging.


Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had several design challenges when some of the content fell off the page. This experience was new, since I typicaly develop web pages, 
so it was helpful to use the Android design screens when developing the UI content. Using the split screen, I could see how widgets were coded when 
dragging and dropping them to the content screen.


In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I understand database schemas pretty well from my job experience so setting up the database structures and objects was simple and came easily. I also feel that
I have a good understanding of writing technical documentation and understanding the importance of including pieces of data that can be 
read and understood by a non-technical audience.
